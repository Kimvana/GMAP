class Reference:
    """The representation of a single reference.

    These instances save all information present in the .bib file, and
    can return it with simple formatting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_string : str
        The string that contains this specific reference.

    Attributes
    ----------
    input_string : str
        The string provided to the __init__ method. This string can be
        used to later see what was used to instantiate the class (and,
        for example, for creating a copy of the instance).
    dir_attr : list
        A list of strings, each string being a field name. These are the
        fields that can be directly read from the .bib file / input
        string.
    all_attr : list
        A list of strings, each string being a field name (except one).
        These are the ones that make up the entire object, and the ones
        that should be reported when printing. If none of these strings
        are also class attributes, this instance is considered 'failed'.
    success : bool
        Whether this object has been interpreted correctly and can be
        used safely by the program.
    title : str
        The title of the paper/article/book/etc as provided in the
        reference.
    author : list
        A list of strings. Each string is a single author with their
        family name first, then their given name(s). The given name(s)
        is/are abbreviated to (a) single letter(s).
    author_raw : list
        A list of strings. Each string is a single author as directly
        cut from the .bib file. It is assumed the bib file always has
        the family name first, given name second.
    year : str
        The string representation of the year the work was published,
        as provided in the reference.
    month : str
        The string representation of the month the work was published,
        as provided in the reference.
    journal : str
        The name of the journal in which the work was published,
        as provided in the reference.
    volume : str
        The string representation of the volume (usually a number) of
        the edition of the journal in which the work was published,
        as provided in the reference.
    number : str
        The string representation of the issue (usually a number) of
        the edition of the journal in which the work was published,
        as provided in the reference.
    pages : str
        The string representation of the page(s) on which the work was
        published, as provided in the reference.
    issn : str
        The string representation of the issn number of the work, as
        provided in the reference.
    doi : str
        The string representation of the DOI assigned to the work, as
        provided in the reference.
    url : str
        The url through which the work was obtained (and can be
        obtained) as provided in the reference.
    mapkey : list
        A list of strings. Each string is one of the keys mentioned in
        the input string. Distinct keys are separated by a semicolon,
        followed by a whitespace: "; "
    reporttext : dict
        A dict of all ways/reasons to report this reference. The keys
        are the possible outputs the program can generate (currently,
        ham, ene, dip, ram, pos, dbp), the values are the text(s) that
        should be printed for that specific output.

        The input string looks like this:

        "ham, ene: print this for hamiltonian and energies output;
        dip: print this for dipole output"

        A text is placed after its associated outputs, separated by a
        colon. If there are multiple different output/text pairs, those
        are separated using a semicolon. When multiple outputs share
        a text, they are separated using a comma.

    called 'flatten_iterable', 'sort_references', 'merge_references'
